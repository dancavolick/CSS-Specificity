  <h2>This table details the Specificity Rules engaged within Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h2>
  <h3>Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most 
      relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied. Specificity is based on the matching 
      rules which are composed of different sorts of CSS selectors</h3>

        <td>Inline Styles</td>
        <td>Keyword "style" followed by the CSS rule within the opening tag of an element within the HTML document</td>
        <td>These appear inline within the HTML document itself and dominate any contrasting rule, for any Selector type, held on an external Stylesheet</td>

  <h2>Key considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><h3>Equal Scoring: If a Selector has been listed in a mutliple Selector ruleset more than once and the rules contrast, the ruleset with the highest score will dominate, for 
        example:
        <br>
        Multiple ruleset one: #id.class p {color="red";}.........Score #id(100) + .class(10) + element(1) = 111
        <br>
        Multiple ruleset two: #id p {color="blue";}..........Score #id(100) + element(1) = 101
        <br>
        Multiple ruleset one will dominate as it calculates to the highest score: 111
    </h3></li>
    <li><h3>Duplication: If there are contrasting rules that have been set at the same level, for example, a developer has inadvertently set 2 different 
      background-colors for the Paragraph Selector, the rule listed furthest down in the Stylesheet dominates</h3></li>
    <li><h3>!important: If the !important rule has been applied to any Selector, that rule will dominate any contrasting rules</h3></li>
  </ul>
